# Week 1: Introduction to Domain/Problem

## Topics
In San Diego, in 2014-15, “does being identified as a certain race cause a person to get pulled over more often?”

### Overview of the quarter / What to expect:
* History of police discrimination; laws governing the purpose of policing and traffic safety.
* Measures of inequality: disparate treatment/impact, counterfactual measures of fairness
* Natural Experiments: measuring causal influence using “Veil of Darkness” technique.
* The case of North Carolina (Citizen Suspects) and Stanford’s Open Policing Project.
* Related questions and investigations: framing student perspective
  for their future proposals. (scaling improving similar analyses;
  trying other causal experiments).
  
### Reading

* Read the first 6 pages of the [SDSU Study](https://spa.sdsu.edu/documents/Traffic_enforcement.pdf). This is the main result replicated during the quarter.

* A news article in December, in the [San Diego Union Tribune](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/story/2019-12-08/another-study-identifies-disparities-in-local-policing-renewing-talks-of-racial-bias-among-officers) about a new study on racial disparities in traffic stops.

* A recent [article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-02/black-drivers-face-more-police-stops-in-california-new-state-data-show) on a California-wide study.

* Browse the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/)

### Topics for Discussion

These questions approach topics that we will spend the majority of the
quarter answering! These are merely to set context!

* What are the basic quantities used to argue that police behavior in
  traffic stops is biased toward certain groups?
* Why are these studies needed? Why is unequal treatment during traffic
  stops undesirable? In what scenarios, if any, might it be ok?
* Who are the involved parties and what stake do they have in the
  outcome of the study? Is this an "us-vs-them" situation, according
  to the stories? Does it have to be?
